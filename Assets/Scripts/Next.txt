French Narrator: Today's controversial topic of discussion is about zoophilia- you know, when humans find animals attractive and hit that shit. 

Spongebob: Hey Patrick, have you heard about zoophilia?

Patrick: What's that?

Spongebob: It's when humans are attracted to animals, and sometimes do filthy things with them.

Patrick: Ewww! That's disgusting!

Spongebob: Unless you're into that, then it's not gross. 

Squidward: Well, I certainly don't approve of it.

Mr. Krabs: Aye, whatever happened to good old-fashioned man-on-woman romance?

Patrick: Yeah, zoophilia sounds like real perverted stuff.

Sandy: Pfft! It's not that bad!

Spongebob: Really Sandy?

Sandy: Sure, if both parties consent, why not?

Squidward: Who would even consent to something like that? 

Mr. Krabs: Ye don't really know where it'll lead so ye better be careful, lad.

Sandy: Well, you don't have to judge just because you don't understand it.

Patrick: Yeah, everyone should just mind their own business. 

Spongebob: Hmm, I guess that's true. 

French Narrator: And that concludes this episode's discussion about zoophilia. I for one am glad we all got to air out our thoughts- just not too close together! Now you know. Now you know.
